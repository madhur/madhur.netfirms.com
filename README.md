## My First Personal Website / Blog

This is the source code of my first personal website / blog hosted on [Netfirms](http://netfirms.com) in year 2004. Yes, 20 years back as of writing this :)

It was hosted on url [http://madhur.netfirms.com](http://madhur.netfirms.com) which is now defunct.

This site utilized following technologies and are one of the first technologies I learnt during my college days in my free time:  
* HTML / CSS
* Perl
* CGI 
* httpd
* Server side includes

The site offered programs I wrote in following languages: 
* Assembly language
* VBScript
* C / C++


The site can still be made runnable using the supplied `Dockerfile`

### Way forward

I found the hosting to be bit expensive and difficult to manage.

Hence, I moved onto [Blogspot](https://www.blogger.com/) in December 2005

[Code, Articles, Discussion on Microsoft Technologies](https://madhurahuja.blogspot.com/) - Dec 2005 - March 2008

Once I moved ot Microsoft, I decided to host the blog on MSDN blogs in March 2008

Later on, I moved to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in order to [blog like a hacker](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker)
