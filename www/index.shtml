  <h1 align=center>WelCome to HomePage of Madhur</h1>
  <h6 align=right><i>Dedicated to Usenet Community;<br>for many questions answered,<br>and many FAQs provided.</i></h6>
  
<p>  At this site I'd like to present you some information on several topics of my interest. These are self written programs and self written texts.</p>
<p>This homepage is result of my learning HTML,CGI and Perl. I didnt did any serious web scripting here. Some of u might feel the contents on these pages to be outdated. These pages were composed only using a text editor and pure HTML, there are no Java scripts, Java applets, cookies or any active code of some kind. Although you can see some as i get some my hand on java ,vbscript,jscript etc.etc.
<p>You'll see this page at its best when using a screen resolution of 1024 * 768 pixels. It should also work with lower resolutions.. Executable files you can download from these pages are free of any viruses (however I don't take any responsibility for what they may do). If you have any questions, suggestions, wishes or complaints, please feel free to send me an e-mail. However, I hope you have fun on my page.
<p>On this Page you will find my programming work and links to 
    other sites(mostly assembly related). I have been programming since 16 and 
    I know C,C++, VC++ although I code mainly asm and some C++ and started coding 
    in windows programming. </p>
