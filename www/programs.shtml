<h1 align="center">Sample Programs</h1>
<p>Some of the program might not have included source code. Its because I intend to enhance those programs in future. 
  If you really need the source code of those programs,email me,they'll cost some bucks though.
  <p>You can e-mail me if you have any questions, feedback, or require my services 
  (will code for $$$).</p>
